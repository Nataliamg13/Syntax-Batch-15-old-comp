Operators:
     Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtractions we can compare
     things if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.
     There are 3 main types of operators. They are: Arithmetic operators
                                                    Relational operator,
                                                    Logical operators.

 Arithmetic operators:
   We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like additions , subtraction etc.
   + => Addition
   - +> Subtraction
   / => Division
   * => Multiplication
   % => modulus , remainder

   Relational operators.
     Relational operators are used to compare 2 quantities or entities, for example if something is Bigger than other
     thing or if 2 numbers are same or not or if 2 boolean variables contain same values or not.
     == => used to check if 2 variables  contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false.
     != => used to check if 2 variables don't contain the same value, we get a true if they are same.
     >  => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a true.
     <  => used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get a True.
     >= => if the value on left is greater than the value on the right side or if they are same we will get true.
     <= => it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to the other thing.

 Conditional constructs
 Used to write conditional code( A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is True than Java
 execute the code otherwise it skips that code.)
 How to write IfElse condition:
 if(condition){
 any line of code

 if(){
 }

 }


Important Notes:
1) For String we use equal method instead of == sign because its a non-primitive data type
2)We can Ctrl+Alt+l(windows) to format our code.
3)If we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part
